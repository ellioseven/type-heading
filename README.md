# Type Heading

Type Heading is a lightweight Compass Extension that lets you easily manage
responsive typographic sizing.

## Libsass Compatible

Ruby is fucking slow as fuck and I hate it. Type heading is 100% (or will try to
be) compatible with Libsass.

## Organised & Maintainable

Reference or change any heading size throughout your stylesheets from a single
variable. Now you don't have to try and remember what the font size of your h3 is!

## Reponsive Typography Made Easy

Headings are stuctured by breakpoint, giving you the power to quickly find the
right heading size for the right media query.

## Simple Unit Conversion

Working with relative units can be tricky. Fortunately Type Heading can convert
px values into relative units, so you can stay you away from any tricky math.

## License

Type Heading uses the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
and always will.
