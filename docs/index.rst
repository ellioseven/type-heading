Libsass Compatible
------------------

Ruby is fucking slow as fuck and I hate it. Type heading is 100% (or will try to
be) compatible with Libsass.

Organised & Maintainable
------------------------

Reference or change any heading size throughout your stylesheets from a single
variable. Now you don't have to try and remember what the font size of your h3 is!

Reponsive Typography Made Easy
------------------------------

Headings are stuctured by breakpoint, giving you the power to quickly find the
right heading size for the right media query.

Simple Unit Conversion
----------------------

Working with relative units can be tricky. Fortunately Type Heading can convert
px values into relative units, so you can stay you away from any tricky math.
